Benchmark that multiplies a `100x100` matrix n times with itself.

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
tbl <- readRDS(here("results", "matmul.rds"))
ggplot(tbl, aes(x = n_matmuls, y = time)) +
  facet_wrap(~ framework, scales = "free_y") +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Number of matrix multiplications", y = "Time (s)") +
  theme_minimal()
```
